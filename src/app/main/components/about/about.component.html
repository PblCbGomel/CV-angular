    I'm programmer, specialising in Front-end development. I'm living and
    studing in Minsk now. And I desire to have a good job :)
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm fond of finding resolve of some interesting tasks, creating a visual
    part of application, working with interfaces and self-developing. So, in the
    future, when I get a big experience in Front-end direction, I wish to learn
    adjacent vectors of web delelopment.

    I've got about 1 year of work experience in Innowise Group, where I've been
    working on several Pet-projects and one internal project.

    Outside of work, I like cooking some intersting dishes (cheesecakes for
    example). Also I'm studying in Faculty of Applied Mathematic and Computer
    Science, where I'm managing a science direction.
